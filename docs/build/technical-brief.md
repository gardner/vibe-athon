# Technical Brief (Read First)

This is your quick-start map to building a Vibe-athon game that sails through judging and runs offline without drama. Share it with your whole team so everyone stays aligned.

## Supported Stack

- Modern browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and offline Chromium packaged on the USB kits.
- JavaScript ES6 features, standard DOM APIs, and local assets.
- Optional libraries: p5.js, Tone.js, and other standalone scripts bundled locally.

## Required Constraints

1. **Single entry point:** `index.html` lives at the root of your submission folder.
2. **Offline-ready:** No external network calls, CDN fonts, or hosted libraries.
3. **Asset discipline:** Keep total package size under PLACEHOLDER MB for smooth judging.
4. **Naming:** Use `Team-Name/index.html` with lowercase, hyphenated folder names.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Clone or download the starter template that matches your skill level.
2. Run your game locally by double-clicking `index.html` to confirm offline behaviour.
3. Add logic, art, and audio in short loops—test after each change.
4. Use localStorage for optional save data (no cloud storage allowed).
5. Zip the folder and test the zip on a second machine before submission.

## Tooling Support

- **Mentor desk:** Ask for help installing local tools or debugging stubborn scripts.
- **USB toolkit:** Includes offline docs for HTML, CSS, JS, p5.js, and PLACEHOLDER extra references.
- **AI assistants:** Prompt responsibly—review generated code for accessibility, bias, and offline safety.

Keep this brief close. It’s the heartbeat of our shared tech expectations.
