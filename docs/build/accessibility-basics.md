# Accessibility Basics

Great games are for everyone. Use these quick wins to make sure your experience feels welcoming, playable, and understandable for all players.

## Visual Design

- Maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text and interactive elements.
- Avoid relying on colour aloneâ€”add icons, patterns, or labels.
- Offer a **reduced motion** toggle if you use heavy animations.

## Input & Controls

- Support keyboard navigation with clear focus styles.
- Provide alternative input options (e.g., on-screen buttons) when possible.
- Include instructions early and repeat them via a help screen.

## Audio & Feedback

- Add captions or subtitles for any dialogue or narration.
- Keep audio levels moderate and provide a mute toggle.
- Use vibrations or visual pulses to reinforce audio cues when appropriate.

## Cognitive Load

- Break explanations into small, friendly chunks.
- Use plain language for AI concepts and define jargon in tooltips or glossaries.
- Offer a pause button or slower mode for thoughtful players.

## Testing Tips

- Run through your game using only the keyboard.
- Try a high-contrast or grayscale filter to spot low-contrast elements.
- Ask a teammate to read text aloud to check clarity and pacing.
