# Quickstart – p5.js

Ready to turn ideas into interactive visuals? This p5.js guide gets your sketch running fast and teaches you how to bundle it for a static export.

## Setup

1. Copy the PLACEHOLDER p5.js starter folder to your team directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser and confirm you see the starter sketch.
3. Explore `sketch.js` to find `setup()` and `draw()`—your playground lives there.

## Core Loop

- Use `setup()` for initial settings like canvas size, colours, and assets.
- Use `draw()` for animation, input handling, and game state updates.
- Create helper functions (e.g., `drawUI()`, `updatePlayer()`) to keep things tidy.

## Teaching AI Concepts

- Visualise probabilities with bars, gradients, or particle effects.
- Simulate model “attention” by highlighting important game elements.
- Show cause-and-effect: reward loops, data bias, or hallucinations.

## Assets & Packaging

1. Store audio, images, and fonts in `/assets` and load them with relative paths.
2. Preload assets in `preload()` so the experience feels snappy.
3. Keep file sizes friendly—compress images and trim audio loops.

## AI Assist Prompts

> “You are a senior p5.js developer. Refactor this code to add keyboard controls for WASD and arrow keys while keeping it export-ready: PLACEHOLDER code snippet.”

## Final Checks

- Zip the project, unzip it somewhere else, and rerun to confirm all assets load.
- Use the [QA checklist](/ship/qa-checklist) to test controls, clarity, and restart flow.
- Record a quick PLACEHOLDER GIF for your demo deck.
