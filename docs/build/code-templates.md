# Code Templates

Drop-in templates help you launch fast without reinventing the basics. Remix them, learn from them, and customise them to match your AI concept.

## Template Library

| Template | Best For | What’s Inside |
| -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Twine Story Kit | Narrative explainers | Styled passages, glossary macro, score tracker |
| p5.js Loop | Visual simulations | Scene manager, input helpers, easing animations |
| Vanilla Canvas | Arcade-style games | Canvas setup, collision helpers, HUD widgets |
| Audio Boost | Sound-driven play | Tone.js starter, volume controls, mute toggle |

Download the full bundle from PLACEHOLDER link or grab individual templates from the mentor USB drives.

## How to Use

1. Copy the template into your team folder.
2. Rename files to match your project.
3. Update colours, fonts, and copy to reflect your theme.
4. Export and re-open the build after every major change to catch broken paths early.

## Customisation Ideas

- Swap placeholder art with your own sprites or generated assets.
- Add accessibility toggles (reduced motion, captions, high-contrast mode).
- Integrate the [QA checklist](/ship/qa-checklist) directly into your workflow.

## Sharing Back
