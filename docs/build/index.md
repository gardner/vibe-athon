## Build Overview

Everything you need to go from blank page to playable vibe-coded game lives here. Start by downloading the right starter kit, then follow the prompt cookbook and workflow playbooks that match your teamâ€™s style.

## Starter kit menu {#starter-kit}

Pick a ZIP that matches your comfort level. Each bundle includes `README.md`, `CONSTRAINTS.md`, `WORKFLOWS.md`, a `context/` folder with prompt stubs, and an `assets/` folder with starter art.

| Kit | Whatâ€™s inside | Ideal for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Basic â€” `/starter-kits/starter-basic.zip`** | Single `index.html` with inline styles and comments pointing to editable sections. | First-time coders collaborating with an LLM in the browser. |
| **Intermediate â€” `starter-intermediate.zip`** | `index.html` + `styles.css` plus a lightweight `assets/` folder. | Makers who want tidy CSS while keeping the export process simple. |
| **Advanced â€” `starter-advanced-react.zip`** | Minimal React setup with a pre-configured `npm run build` that outputs a static `dist/` folder. | Experienced devs who are comfortable exporting static builds. |

ðŸ“Œ **Reminder:** Every team must follow the [Technical Requirements](/build/technical-requirements). Advanced kits are welcomeâ€”as long as you include the built output that runs without extra setup.

## Prompt cookbook

Reuse these copy-pastable recipes to steer your AI buddy:

- **One-shot bootstrap.** Generate a playable static HTML game that fits the Vibe-athon constraints.
- **Tweak without regressions.** Ask for incremental updates that preserve existing IDs, functions, and styles.
- **Paste constraints first.** Start every conversation with your `CONSTRAINTS.md` so the model honours the rules.
- **Context folder pattern.** Stack snippets from `context/`â€”mechanics, assets, copyâ€”and add a focused ask at the end.

## Workflow playbooks

Choose the setup that matches your hardware and teamwork style:

- **Browser-only loop.** ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude in the browser â†’ copy/paste into the starter file â†’ refresh.
- **Editor + AI pair.** VS Code with Cursor, Copilot, or Codium â†’ Live Server preview â†’ commit frequent checkpoints.
- **Repo-first.** GitHub repo + PRs reviewed with Cursor/Codium â†’ merge â†’ export the final static build.

Each playbook is mirrored in the starter kit `WORKFLOWS.md` so everyone can stay in sync without hunting through chats.

## Tools & local setup

- Free first: CodeSandbox, Replit, VS Code, Viteâ€™s Live Server, Firefox/Chrome dev tools.
- Bring your own LLM logins or tap the NAIS AI Sandbox accounts on-site (details in `README.md`).
- Quick preview: run a local server or open the HTML file directly; DevToolsâ€™ Performance tab will help you watch for jank.

## Inspiration gallery

Spark ideas with 20 one-liner concepts (hidden in `context/ideas.md`) and three runnable examples from past Vibe-athon experiments. Remix, mash-up, or use them as warm-up prompts before the sprint.
