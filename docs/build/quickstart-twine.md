# Quickstart – Twine

This is the express lane to shipping a narrative AI game with Twine. You’ll go from idea to export in under an hour, with optional AI assist prompts when you need them.

## Setup

1. Download Twine from the USB toolkit or [twinery.org](https://twinery.org) ahead of the event.
2. Open the PLACEHOLDER starter project and rename it with your team name.
3. Skim the `Start Here` passage for built-in instructions.

## Build Your Story

- Use **passages** for scenes, choices, and endings.
- Add variables for score, knowledge checks, or AI concept tracking.
- Drop in CSS or JavaScript in the Story menu to customise the look and feel.

## Teach an AI Concept

- Add tooltips or glossary pop-ups for key terms.
- Use branching choices to show how prompts, data, or feedback change outcomes.
- Include a recap at the end that reinforces what the player learned.

## Export & Test

1. Select **Publish to File** and save as `index.html`.
2. Double-click the file locally to confirm everything loads after you move it into your submission folder.
3. Run through the [QA checklist](/ship/qa-checklist) focusing on links, text clarity, and readability.

## AI Assist Prompts

Try this when collaborating with an LLM:
