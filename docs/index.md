## Start your Vibe-athon mission

Welcome to the **NAIS Vibe-athon Handbook**â€”your hype squad, toolbox, and technical map rolled into one joyful website. Every page keeps the language friendly and the steps bite-sized so you can focus on building something brilliant.

## Choose your launch path

Pick the starter that feels closest to your strengths. You can always swap later.

<div class="starter-buttons">
  <a class="vp-button" href="/people/paths/prompt-engineer">I'm new to coding â†’ Start with Prompt Engineer path</a>
  <a class="vp-button" href="/people/paths/code-mechanic">I can code â†’ Start with Code Mechanic path</a>
  <a class="vp-button" href="/people/paths/designer-dreamer">I do design or story â†’ Start with Designer path</a>
</div>

## How this handbook works

1. **Orient** in the [Guide section](/guide/index) to learn how the day flows and what the judges expect.
2. **Build** with ready-to-run templates, prompt recipes, and quickstart walkthroughs in the [Build section](/build/index).
3. **Create** polish by tapping art, narrative, and audio prompts in the [Create section](/create/index).
4. **Ship** your game with checklists and submission tips from the [Ship section](/ship/index).
5. **Loop back** to [Judging](/judging/index), [People](/people/index), and [Ops](/ops/index) whenever you need deeper support.

We designed the flow so you can skim in order or jump straight to what matters most right now.
