## What is vibe-coding?

Vibe-coding is our friendly name for building a playful, learning-focused mini-game with the help of AI toolsâ€”fast. Youâ€™ll prep a static export with `index.html` at the root, use prompts as power-ups, and keep the vibes collaborative from kickoff to demos.

## Youâ€™ll leave withâ€¦

- A working zipped mini-game you can proudly share.
- Better instincts for prompting, testing, and iterating with AI partners.
- Bragging rights, new teammates, and stories for the group chat.

## What to expect on the day
