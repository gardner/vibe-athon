## What is vibe-coding?

Vibe-coding is our friendly name for building a playful, learning-focused mini-game with the help of AI toolsâ€”fast. Youâ€™ll wrangle a single `index.html`, use prompts as power-ups, and keep the vibes collaborative from kickoff to demos.

## Youâ€™ll leave withâ€¦

- A working single-file mini-game you can proudly share.
- Better instincts for prompting, testing, and iterating with AI partners.
- Bragging rights, new teammates, and stories for the group chat.

## What to expect on the day

**9:00 â€“ Kickoff.** Welcome, vibe check, and walk-through of the single-file rules.

**9:30 â€“ Build sprint.** Form teams, claim a starter kit, and co-build with your LLM of choice.

**11:30 â€“ Playtest loop.** Swap stations, gather feedback, and tighten your core mechanic.

**12:30 â€“ Demo prep.** Validate your ZIP, rehearse the 2-minute story, and upload.

**1:00 â€“ Demos & judging.** Present, celebrate, and cheer on the crowd favourites.
