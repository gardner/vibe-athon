# Judging Rubric

Use this rubric as the definitive scoring guide. Every judge rates each category from 1–5; scores are weighted by the percentages below.

| Category | Weight | Judges look for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Learning Impact (AI Fundamentals)** | 25% | The game teaches or demonstrates a real AI concept with accuracy and clarity. Players leave smarter than they arrived. |
| **Creative Use of AI** | 20% | AI-generated assets, mechanics, or interactions feel intentional and elevate the experience instead of distracting from it. |
| **Gameplay & Fun** | 25% | The core loop is engaging, understandable within two minutes, and encourages players to try again. |
| **Craft & Polish** | 15% | Visuals, audio, and UX choices feel cohesive. Bugs are minor and don’t block play. |
| **Presentation & Team Storytelling** | 15% | The demo is confident, timeboxed, and clearly explains the learning goal, build approach, and team takeaways. |

## Tips for scoring well

- Spotlight the learning outcome early in your demo so judges can connect it to the gameplay moments they’re scoring.
- Call out how AI helped you build faster or smarter—judges love seeing intentional workflows.
- Practice with the [Demo Script](/ship/demo-script) to keep the presentation crisp.
- Run the [QA checklist](/ship/qa-checklist) so craft issues don’t cost you points.

Bonus awards (Crowd Favourite, Spectacular Fail, etc.) are announced on the day and don’t affect the main scoring.
