## Ship Overview

This section is your final pit stop before the judges see your work. Follow the shared requirements, run the checks, and rehearse your two-minute story so every team finishes strong.

## Rules & constraints

- Start with the [Technical Requirements](/build/technical-requirements) for the authoritative checklist.
- Zip your project once (`team-name.zip`) and keep it under 25 MB for quick uploads.
- Your build must open from `index.html` without extra installs on the latest Chrome.

Use the upcoming **Validate my ZIP** tool to lint file size, asset references, and README basics *before* you upload.

## Judging snapshot

Judges score every game using the [official rubric](/ship/judging-rubric). Learn it, rehearse to it, and design your demo around the learning impact, gameplay fun, and storytelling beats they’ll evaluate.

Bonus shout-outs—like **Most Spectacular Fail** and **Crowd Favourite**—are announced on the day and don’t affect core scoring.

## Submission flow

1. Zip your project folder and run **Validate my ZIP** (available from `/ship/submission-rules`).
2. Upload the ZIP, add your team name, 140-character blurb, and confirm the consent/license tickboxes.
3. Watch the countdown timer for the hand-in deadline; late uploads will be marked as exhibition-only.
4. Receive your auto-generated demo order in the staging area.

## Demo checklist

- Keep the run-through to two minutes max.
- Show the core mechanic, the AI insight, and one thing you learned.
- Mention any bugs or hilarious edge cases—judges love honesty.
- Have Chrome open, zoom set, and keyboard focus ready for accessibility checks.
