## Ship Overview

This section is your final pit stop before the judges see your work. Follow the rules, run the automated checks, and rehearse your two-minute story so every team finishes strong.

## Rules & constraints

- Submit a single `index.html` file ≤ 2 MB with inline CSS and JS.
- No external network calls, CDNs, or runtime fetches—package everything locally.
- Must run in the latest Chrome on desktop; mobile-friendly and accessible (tab order + alt text) strongly encouraged.

Use the upcoming **Validate my ZIP** tool to lint file size, inline assets, and accessibility basics *before* you upload.

## Judging rubric

| Category | Weight | What judges look for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Best AI Fundamentals** | 30% | Does the game teach or demonstrate core AI ideas clearly? |
| **Best Use of AI** | 25% | How cleverly does the experience use AI interactions or design? |
| **Gameplay & Fun** | 25% | Is it engaging, replayable, and intuitive in two minutes? |
| **Visual Polish & UX** | 10% | Are visuals cohesive with readable typography and strong contrast? |
| **Presentation & Clarity** | 10% | Does the team explain the concept, constraints, and learnings succinctly? |

Bonus shout-outs: **Most Spectacular Fail**, **Crowd Favourite**, and other vibe-forward awards will be announced on the day.

## Submission flow

1. Zip your project folder and run **Validate my ZIP** (available from `/ship/submission-rules`).
2. Upload the ZIP, add your team name, 140-character blurb, and confirm the consent/license tickboxes.
3. Watch the countdown timer for the hand-in deadline; late uploads will be marked as exhibition-only.
4. Receive your auto-generated demo order in the staging area.

## Demo checklist

- Keep the run-through to two minutes max.
- Show the core mechanic, the AI insight, and one thing you learned.
- Mention any bugs or hilarious edge cases—judges love honesty.
- Have Chrome open, zoom set, and keyboard focus ready for accessibility checks.
