# Submission Rules

Follow these steps to hand in your project smoothly and keep the judging team on schedule.

## Package Structure

```markdown
Team-Name/
  index.html
  icon.png
  assets/
    images/

  README.md
```

- No nested zips. Submit one clean folder zipped once.
- `icon.png` is used as your team's logo
- Keep filenames lowercase with hyphens.
- Keep the final ZIP under 25 MB—trim unused assets before exporting.

## Required Materials

- Final game build (`index.html` + assets).
- `README.md` with play instructions, team credits, and tool usage.
- PLACEHOLDER screenshot or GIF for the showcase gallery.

## Hand-In Process

1. Zip your folder (`team-name.zip`).
2. Upload to the staging portal at PLACEHOLDER URL **or** copy to the official USB stick at the help desk.
3. Confirm your upload with the tech volunteer—don’t leave until you get the thumbs-up.

## Deadline Policy

- Submissions close at **4:30 PM sharp**.
- Late submissions require organiser approval and may not be judged.
- If you foresee a blocker, notify us before the deadline so we can help.

## After Submission
