# Staging & Hand-In

This is where your hard work goes from laptop to judging queue. Follow the steps to keep the pipeline running smoothly.

## Before You Arrive

- Run the [QA checklist](/ship/qa-checklist).
- Save your final zip as `Team-Name.zip`.
- Prepare a one-sentence summary for the staging log.

## Staging Portal Upload

1. Visit PLACEHOLDER staging URL (available on-site and in the offline kit).
2. Log in with your team code from registration.
3. Upload your zip and fill in the summary form.
4. Wait for the “Upload Complete” confirmation before closing the tab.

## USB Hand-In Backup

1. Head to the staging desk with your labelled USB stick.
2. Copy the zip into the folder assigned to your team.
3. Sign the hand-in sheet so we can track submissions.

## Verification Process

- Tech volunteers run an offline smoke test and folder check.
- If we spot an issue, we’ll ping you via PLACEHOLDER messaging channel.
- Fixes must be delivered before the deadline to count.

## After Hand-In

- Keep your laptop handy for last-minute fixes if requested.
- Get ready for demos—check the [Demo Script](/judging/demo-script).
- Celebrate and hydrate while we finalise the judging roster.

Thank you for keeping the staging process smooth for everyone!
