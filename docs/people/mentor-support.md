# Mentor Support

Mentors are your secret weapon. They’re here to unblock, encourage, and celebrate every team—no gatekeeping, ever.

## How to Ask for Help

1. Check the mentor schedule on the PLACEHOLDER info screen.
2. Visit the table matching your need (Code, Design, Accessibility, Audio, Ops).
3. Share your blocker, what you’ve tried, and what success looks like.

## Mentor Etiquette

- Be respectful of time—keep questions focused.
- Invite mentors into your repo or doc if they need context.
- Credit mentors in your README if their support shaped your game.

## Mentor Coverage

Mentors are teammates in your corner—use them early and often.
