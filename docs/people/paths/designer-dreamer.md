## Designer Dreamer Path

You bring vibes, empathy, and cohesion to the team. As the Designer Dreamer, you ensure the experience feels intentional—from the first screen to the final moment—while balancing scope and accessibility.

## When to choose this path

- You love shaping player journeys, UI flows, and narrative beats.
- You get energy from making complex ideas feel welcoming and inclusive.
- Your team needs someone to champion the “why” behind each creative choice.

## 30-minute starter checklist

1. Align on the player promise: what should someone feel or learn by the end?
2. Map the core loop using quick sketches or post-its.
3. Choose a visual direction and gather inspiration references.
4. Pair with the Prompt Engineer or Code Mechanic to confirm any art or UI constraints.
5. Identify accessibility must-haves (contrast, captions, input options) you’ll check later.

## Go-to handbook boosts

- [Create → Writing Clarity](/create/writing-clarity) to sharpen copy and learning goals.
- [Create → Images & Art Pipelines](/create/images-art-pipelines) for quick visual production.
- [Create → AI Audio & Music](/create/ai-audio-music) to set the mood fast.
- [Judging → Demo Script](/judging/demo-script) to craft a resonant presentation.

## Team handoffs

Share moodboards and UI references with the whole team. Pair with the Data Storyteller to validate clarity and with the Accessibility Avenger to run inclusive design checks before shipping.
