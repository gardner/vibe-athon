## Prompt Engineer Path

You love pairing with AI tools, remixing templates, and keeping experiments lightweight. As the Prompt Engineer, you turn ideas into playable prototypes in record time while sharing discoveries with the rest of the team.

## When to choose this path

- You prefer coaxing results from AI models rather than writing long-form code.
- You enjoy stitching together no-code tools, APIs, or spreadsheets to prove a concept quickly.
- Your team needs someone to translate creative ideas into interactive prototypes.

## 30-minute starter checklist

1. Align with your team on the core learning goal and tone.
2. Open the [Choose Your Path guide](/build/choose-your-path) and confirm the template that fits your scope.
3. Draft a set of prompts or automations you’ll iterate on first.
4. Set up a shared doc or channel to log prompt experiments and results.
5. Schedule sync points with the Code Mechanic or Designer to hand off assets smoothly.

## Go-to handbook boosts

- [Build → Quickstart – Twine](/build/quickstart-twine) for branching stories.
- [Build → Quickstart – Vanilla JS](/build/quickstart-vanilla) if you need light custom code.
- [Create → Prompting For Non-Coders](/create/prompting-for-non-coders) for rapid iteration tips.
- [Ship → QA Checklist](/ship/qa-checklist) to confirm your AI-assisted flows stay stable.

## Team handoffs

Share prompt logs with the Code Mechanic for validation and with the Designer Dreamer for tone and accessibility review. Pair with the Data Storyteller to translate AI-generated content into clear player-facing explanations.
