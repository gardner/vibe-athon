## Data Storyteller Path

You excel at translating complex ideas into language everyone can understand. As the Data Storyteller, you make sure the team’s learning goals shine through the gameplay, pitch, and supporting materials.

## When to choose this path

- You enjoy writing copy, scripts, or tooltips that make experiences intuitive.
- You naturally interpret analytics, research, or mentor feedback for the team.
- You want to lead the demo story so judges feel the impact of your work.

## 30-minute starter checklist

1. Interview teammates to capture the core learning objective and player promise.
2. Outline the pitch narrative: hook, mechanic, impact, and next steps.
3. Draft key in-game text (tutorials, tooltips, success states).
4. Coordinate with the Designer Dreamer on tone, readability, and accessibility.
5. Plan how you’ll capture evidence (screenshots, quotes, metrics) for judging.

## Go-to handbook boosts

- [Create → Writing Clarity](/create/writing-clarity) to keep language friendly and precise.
- [Judging → Demo Script](/judging/demo-script) for structuring your presentation.
- [Judging → Rubric](/judging/rubric) to align your story with scoring criteria.
- [Ship → Submission Rules](/ship/submission-rules) so supporting docs hit every requirement.

## Team handoffs

Share draft copy with the Prompt Engineer and Code Mechanic to embed text in builds. Partner with the Accessibility Avenger to verify readability, captions, and alt text before final submission.
