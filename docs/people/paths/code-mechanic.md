## Code Mechanic Path

The Code Mechanic is your team’s reliability engine. You wrangle repos, optimize performance, and ensure integrations stay solid. When prototypes need custom logic or bug fixes, you’re the one with a plan.

## When to choose this path

- You’re comfortable editing code directly and reviewing pull requests quickly.
- You love tuning performance, debugging tricky bugs, or wiring up APIs.
- Your team needs someone to say “yes” or “no” to scope changes grounded in effort.

## 30-minute starter checklist

1. Clone or download the [starter templates](/build/code-templates) your team is considering.
2. Confirm environment setup—editor, package manager, and offline docs.
3. Audit the backlog for technical risks and set time-boxed experiments.
4. Pair with the Prompt Engineer to validate AI-generated code before it ships.
5. Note accessibility and performance checks you’ll run later in the day.

## Go-to handbook boosts

- [Build → Technical Brief](/build/technical-brief) for architecture choices.
- [Build → Common Patterns](/build/common-patterns) to reuse proven snippets.
- [Ship → QA Checklist](/ship/qa-checklist) and [Ship → Submission Rules](/ship/submission-rules) for final sign-off.
- [Ops → Troubleshooting](/ops/troubleshooting) when hardware or network gremlins appear.

## Team handoffs

Sync with the Designer Dreamer to keep UI/UX and performance aligned. Partner with the Accessibility Avenger to validate contrast, controls, and assistive tech compatibility before final build.
