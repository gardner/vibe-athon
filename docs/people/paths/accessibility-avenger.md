## Accessibility Avenger Path

You’re the guardian of inclusive play. As the Accessibility Avenger, you ensure the experience works for diverse abilities, devices, and contexts. You help the team make thoughtful choices that welcome every learner.

## When to choose this path

- You have experience with accessibility guidelines, assistive tech, or inclusive pedagogy.
- You notice when interactions create barriers and enjoy fixing them.
- Your team needs someone to run equity-minded reviews during crunch time.

## 30-minute starter checklist

1. Review the [Accessibility Basics guide](/build/accessibility-basics) and list must-do checks for your project.
2. Audit early wireframes or prototypes for color contrast, caption needs, and input flexibility.
3. Coordinate with the Code Mechanic to plan semantic HTML and keyboard support.
4. Pair with the Data Storyteller to ensure copy is plain-language and descriptive.
5. Prepare a lightweight accessibility report template for final submission.

## Go-to handbook boosts

- [Build → Accessibility Basics](/build/accessibility-basics) for quick reference.
- [Ship → QA Checklist](/ship/qa-checklist) to bake accessibility into final reviews.
- [Create → Writing Clarity](/create/writing-clarity) for inclusive language tips.
- [Ops → Offline Survival Kit](/ops/offline-survival-kit) to plan for low-connectivity scenarios.

## Team handoffs

Meet regularly with the Designer Dreamer to confirm inclusive visuals and UI patterns. Share findings with the entire team so accessibility fixes land early, not during submission crunch.
