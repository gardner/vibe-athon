# IP & Licensing at the Event

We keep things simple: you own what you create, and NAIS celebrates your work with credit wherever it’s shared. Here’s how we handle intellectual property and licensing so everyone stays aligned.

## Ownership

- **Participants retain full ownership** of their code, art, audio, and narrative created during the Vibe-athon.
- NAIS requests **non-exclusive rights** to showcase your project on the NAIS website, social channels, and future event materials.
- You can continue developing, publishing, or commercialising your game after the event without restrictions.

## Open Sharing Encouraged

- We love open source! If you choose to publish your code or assets under an open licence, highlight it in your submission notes.
- Not ready to open source? Totally fine. Just make sure your distribution plan matches your team’s comfort level.

## Third-Party Assets & Tools

- Use assets and libraries that allow redistribution in an offline package.
- Keep a list of sources, licences, and attributions for the judges and publishing team.
- When in doubt, pick Creative Commons, royalty-free, or your own original work.

## AI-Generated Content

- Document which models or tools you used (e.g., PLACEHOLDER art generator name) so we can credit responsibly.
- Double-check usage rights for generated assets—some tools limit commercial use.

## Submission Checklist

- Include a short `LICENSE` or credits section in your `README` or submission form.
- Credit every teammate, mentor, and source that helped.
- Flag any content that should stay private when we prep the showcase.

Have questions? Chat with the mentor desk or the NAIS legal liaison at PLACEHOLDER contact info. We’re here to keep things transparent and fair.
