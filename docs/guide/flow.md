## Handbook Flow

The Vibe-athon handbook is designed for momentum. You can read it front-to-back, but most teams hop between sections as needs pop up. Use this overview to understand how the pieces fit together and how to loop in the right guidance at the right time.

## The fast-track loop

1. **Guide** — Align on the event mission, rules, daily milestones, and team roles.
2. **Build** — Choose a starter path, grab a template, and get your core mechanic playable.
3. **Create** — Add polish with art, audio, narrative, and learning clarity.
4. **Ship & Demo** — Run QA, package your project, lock the submission, and rehearse the pitch.

Throughout the day, swing through **Ops** for logistics or emergency backups.

## When to switch tracks

- **Stuck choosing tech?** Jump from Guide directly to [Build](/build/index).
- **Need story inspiration?** Skip to [Create](/create/index) even while the core loop is under construction.
- **Crunch time looming?** Move into [Ship](/ship/index) two hours before hand-in.
- **Team alignment slipping?** Revisit [Team Roles & Support](/guide/team-roles) to rebalance responsibilities.

## Remix the flow for your team

- **Prompt Pilots** can prototype fast, then lean on Create for clarity.
- **Code Mechanics** may iterate between Build and Ship to harden the tech.
- **Experience Leads** should tag-team Build early to lock constraints, then lead Create.
- **Clarity Coaches** keep the learning goals obvious across every stage.

## Share the plan with your team

Print or copy this flow into your team chat so everyone knows the next pit stop. Consistent check-ins every 90 minutes keep you ahead of the curve and give mentors time to step in before a blocker grows.
