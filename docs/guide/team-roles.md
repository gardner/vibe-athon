# Team Roles & Support

Keep roles lightweight and flexible—teams swap hats all day. Use this snapshot to cover the essentials without digging through persona deep-dives.

## Core personas at a glance

- **Prompt Pilot:** Steers AI prompts, curates outputs, and keeps constraints in front of every model conversation.
- **Code Mechanic:** Integrates snippets, solves bugs, and makes sure the exported build runs without surprises.
- **Experience Lead:** Shapes narrative, UX flow, and presentation moments that highlight the learning goal.
- **Clarity Coach:** Translates the AI concept, writes tooltips and recaps, and sanity-checks the onboarding flow.

Rotate tasks often—most teams blend responsibilities instead of assigning permanent roles.

## Mentor touchpoints

- **Debug desk:** Drop in for gnarly JavaScript issues, export problems, or last-minute asset bundling.
- **Prompt review:** Book 10-minute slots to sanity-check tricky LLM instructions or reduce hallucinations.
- **Story & demo coaching:** Facilitators can rehearse your pitch, tighten the learning arc, and timebox the run-through.

## How to use this page

1. Share the role descriptions in your kickoff huddle so everyone sees the coverage.
2. Identify gaps—if nobody is confident in exports, ask for a mentor early.
3. Revisit before lunch and again before QA hour to rebalance workloads.
