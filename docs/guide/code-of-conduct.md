# Code of Conduct

We follow the spirit and letter of the [MLH Hackathon Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf) to keep the Vibe-athon welcoming, safe, and empowering for every participant. By staying true to these standards, we amplify the NAIS values of openness, inclusion, and community care.

## Be Respectful

- Treat everyone with kindness, empathy, and patience.
- Harassment, discrimination, intimidation, or exclusionary behaviour is never acceptable.
- If someone says “stop,” respect it immediately.

## Look Out for Each Other

- Report concerns to any organiser or mentor right away—no issue is too small.
- Organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings or removal from the event, to protect the community.
- We will involve venue security or local authorities when necessary for safety.

## Keep the Space Inclusive

- Share the spotlight and invite quieter voices into the conversation.
- Use tools, language, and content that welcome people of all backgrounds and abilities.
- Respect different working styles—LLM-heavy teams and code-first teams both belong here.

## Work Honestly

- Only submit work created during the event.
- Honour licensing requirements for assets and tools.
- Credit teammates, mentors, and community resources.

## Take Care of Yourself

- Rest, hydrate, and take breaks. Ask for help when you need it.
- Let us know about accessibility or safety needs—we’ll support you.

If you experience or witness a Code of Conduct issue, contact PLACEHOLDER hotline details or find an organiser in a green NAIS badge. We respond quickly, discreetly, and with care.

Let’s build together in a space where everyone feels seen, valued, and excited to create.
