## Team Rituals

- **Stand-ups:** Short, upbeat, and inclusive. Share wins, blockers, and next steps.
- **Mentor office hours:** Rotating support tables—check the PLACEHOLDER schedule board.
- **Stretch + snack breaks:** Bodies and brains need fuel. We plan for them.

## Pro Tips

- Timebox your core loop early, then polish.
- Keep an eye on the offline requirement—test in airplane mode before QA hour.
- Aim to hand in 15 minutes before the deadline to beat the rush.

You’ve got this. We’re cheering every step of the way.
