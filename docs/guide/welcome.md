# Welcome & Event Overview

Welcome to the NAIS Vibe-athon! This handbook is your friendly co-pilot from doors-open to the final demo. Weâ€™re all about open arms, open minds, and zero gatekeepingâ€”so every player, whether youâ€™re coding by hand or partnering with an AI, finds a confident path to launch.

## What Happens at the Vibe-athon?

- **Create a playable browser game in a day.** Youâ€™ll teach an AI concept through playful interaction.
- **Export a static build.** Keep `index.html` at the root, zip the folder, and make sure it opens without extra installs.
- **Work however you like.** Prompt, pair-program, sketch, prototypeâ€”every style is welcome.
- **Share your build.** Youâ€™ll demo to judges, mentors, and the NAIS community.

## Community Energy

We celebrate curiosity, kindness, and collaboration. Ask questions, offer help, and respect each personâ€™s pace. The tech team, mentors, and fellow participants are here so nobody feels stuck or left out.
