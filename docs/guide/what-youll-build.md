# What You’ll Build

Your mission: ship a small, joyful browser game that teaches a real AI concept. Everything you produce should live in a single project folder that zips cleanly and opens in a browser without extra installs.

## Core Requirements

- **Static export.** `index.html` sits at the root of your zipped folder and runs when opened.
- **No gated APIs.** Skip services that require API keys or logins; the experience should boot for judges instantly.
- **Educational twist.** Players should learn something about AI systems, ethics, or workflows.
- **Playable end-to-end.** Someone should be able to start, understand the controls, finish, and replay.

## Nice-to-Haves

- **Responsive layout.** Works on laptops, Chromebooks, and large tablets.
- **Keyboard + mouse support.** Bonus points for touch controls.
- **Narrative beats.** Teach while you entertain.

## Build Flow Snapshot

1. Pick a template or starter path in the [Build section](/build/technical-requirements).
2. Prototype your core loop quickly—text-only is fine!
3. Layer in art, audio, or narrative using the [Create section](/create/prompting-for-non-coders).
4. Run the [QA checklist](/ship/qa-checklist) and confirm everything works after zipping.
5. Hand-in via the [submission process](/ship/submission-rules).
