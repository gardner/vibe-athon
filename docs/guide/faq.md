# FAQ

We gathered the most common questions from past events so you can get answers fast. Can’t find what you need? Ping a mentor or organiser—no question is too small.

## General

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**  
A: Nope! You can build with templates, drag-and-drop tools, or AI-generated code. We’ll help you find a starting point that fits.

**Q: Can I arrive without a team?**  
A: Absolutely. We’ll run a friendly team formation mixer using the personas in the [People section](/people/persona-paths).

**Q: What if I need to leave early?**  
A: Let your team and an organiser know. We can help you hand off work or adjust judging expectations.

## Tech & Tools

**Q: Are we allowed to use libraries like p5.js or Tone.js?**  
A: Yes—bundle the files locally so the game still runs offline.

**Q: Can we pull data from an external API?**  
A: Not during gameplay. If you need dynamic content, bake it into your assets or simulate it.

**Q: Will there be computers or do we bring our own?**  
A: Bring your own device if possible. We’ll have a limited number of loaners—ask early via PLACEHOLDER sign-up form.

## Submission & Judging

**Q: How do we submit?**  
A: Follow the [submission rules](/ship/submission-rules) and hand in via the staging portal or USB fallback.

**Q: What if our game breaks during judging?**  
A: The tech team will help triage basic issues, but you’ll score best if you’ve run the [QA checklist](/ship/qa-checklist).

**Q: Do we get to keep working on the game afterward?**  
A: Yes! We’ll share the publishing workflow in the [Ship section](/ship/post-event-publishing) so you can polish and relaunch.
