# Offline Survival Kit

Wi-Fi can wobble. Your game shouldn’t. Here’s what’s packed into the offline kit and how to make the most of it.

## What’s Inside

- Portable Chromium browser installer.
- Documentation PDFs for HTML, CSS, JS, p5.js, and Tone.js.
- Starter templates zipped and ready to copy.
- PLACEHOLDER quick-start videos in MP4 format.

## How to Use It

1. Plug in the USB and copy the toolkit folder to your device.
2. Install the offline browser if you need a clean test environment.
3. Open the docs folder and bookmark anything relevant.
4. Launch templates directly from the USB if your device storage is tight.

## Offline Best Practices

- Test your game in airplane mode after each major change.
- Keep a text file with bug notes and ideas while offline.
- Sync back to cloud repos once you’re online again.

## Need More Copies?

- Borrow a spare USB from the help desk.
- Share files peer-to-peer over the local network (instructions in PLACEHOLDER doc).

The offline kit is your safety net—lean on it if the internet disappears.
