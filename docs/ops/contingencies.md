# Contingencies

Stuff happens. Here’s how we keep the Vibe-athon rolling no matter what surprises appear.

## Wi-Fi Dropout

- Switch to offline mode and continue development locally.
- Use the [Offline Survival Kit](/ops/offline-survival-kit) for docs and templates.
- Sync back to staging once connectivity returns.

## Hardware Failure

- Borrow a loaner laptop from the help desk (limited supply—act fast).
- Access your files from backups or USB copies.
- Pair up with another team briefly if you need to keep work moving.

## Team Member Emergency

- Inform organisers so we can support everyone involved.
- Re-scope to a smaller feature set if needed.
- Mentors can help redistribute workload or pair with another team.

## Submission Blocker

- Flag the issue at the staging desk immediately.
- We’ll log the problem, assist with triage, and document any grace period granted.

## Venue Issue

- Follow organiser instructions and stay calm.
- Emergency assembly point: PLACEHOLDER location.
- Bring devices and USBs with you if it’s safe to do so.

Preparation keeps the vibes high. Lean on the team, mentors, and organisers—we’ve got backup plans for our backup plans.
