# Basic Starter Kit

Welcome to the basic Vibe-athon starter kit. This bundle is a single-page HTML project designed for teams who want to prototype quickly without worrying about build tools or complex file structures.

## What's Included

- `index.html` with inline CSS and comments marking the sections you can edit.
- `CONSTRAINTS.md` outlining the boundaries to keep the project shippable.
- `WORKFLOWS.md` describing suggested collaboration loops.
- `context/` prompt stubs to help your team kick off ideation.
- `assets/` placeholder art assets you can swap with your own visuals.

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to verify everything loads locally.
2. Replace the sample hero copy and feature callouts with your concept.
3. Use the prompt stubs to generate art, copy, or mechanics.
4. Keep the constraints in mind when expanding beyond the starter layout.

## Exporting

When you're ready to submit, zip the entire folder. Anyone should be able to double-click `index.html` and see your experience without additional tooling.
