# Collaboration Workflows

## Browser-only iteration
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Pair with your LLM to draft updates directly in the HTML comment markers.
3. Refresh the page to validate changes and capture feedback screenshots.

## Copywriting loop
1. Use the `context/prompt-brief.md` stub to generate story beats.
2. Draft copy variations and review them together in a shared doc.
3. Paste the final text into the hero and callout sections of `index.html`.

## Visual polish sprint
1. Check `assets/placeholder.txt` for the required art dimensions.
2. Generate or source new art, keeping filenames consistent.
3. Swap the files in `assets/` and update the `<img>` paths inside `index.html`.
