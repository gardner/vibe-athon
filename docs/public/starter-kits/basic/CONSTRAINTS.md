# Constraints

- **Single file build.** Keep all logic and styling inside `index.html` so the experience works without a bundler.
- **No backend or API calls.** The game must run entirely in the browser without relying on 3rd party API calls or backend services.
- **Lightweight media.** Optimize images and audio so the entire folder stays under 25 MB.
- **Accessible defaults.** Maintain sufficient color contrast and provide descriptive text for interactive elements.
- **Document changes.** Update this folder's README if you add or remove files so collaborators stay aligned.
