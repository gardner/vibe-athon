# Prompting For Non-Coders

No code? No problem. Think of AI tools as teammates who write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when you give them clear direction. Here’s how to prompt with confidence.

## Ground Rules

- Start with the goal: What should the player learn or feel?
- Share the constraints: single HTML file, offline-friendly, accessible.
- Ask for short chunks of code so you can test quickly.

## Prompt Framework

1. **Role:** “You are a friendly front-end developer.”
2. **Task:** “Build a dialogue box that teaches PLACEHOLDER AI concept.”
3. **Constraints:** “Use vanilla JS, no external libraries.”
4. **Output:** “Return HTML, CSS, and JS in one block.”

## Example Prompt

> “You are a senior web dev helping me with an offline hackathon project. Create a simple quiz with three buttons that teaches players about AI hallucinations. Include inline CSS for styling, keep the code under 100 lines, and explain how to change the questions.”

## Review Checklist

- Does the code run when you paste it into `index.html`?
- Are there any external links or CDN references? Remove them.
- Is the text inclusive and clear? Edit it to match your team voice.

## Iterate With AI

- Ask for improvements: accessibility tweaks, keyboard controls, or hints.
- Paste your current code and say “Fix the bug where PLACEHOLDER issue happens.”
- Request test cases or QA checklists to catch issues early.

Stay curious, stay in control, and treat the AI like a collaborator—not an authority.
