# Ethics & Safety

AI literacy games should empower players to think critically and compassionately. Use these guidelines to keep your storytelling grounded, responsible, and inclusive.

## Respect Your Players

- Avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or biased narratives.
- Provide content warnings if you touch on sensitive topics.
- Offer choices that let players explore without feeling trapped or judged.

## Teach Responsible AI

- Highlight both benefits and risks—don’t oversimplify.
- Show the impact of biased data, hallucinations, or privacy breaches in clear language.
- Encourage reflection moments where players consider real-world implications.

## Data & Privacy

- Do not collect real personal data during gameplay.
- If you use fictional datasets, label them clearly as simulated.
- Avoid referencing actual private individuals or organisations.

## Inclusive Collaboration

- Credit every contributor, mentor, and source.
- Invite feedback from teammates with different perspectives.
- Celebrate ethical wins during your demo—judges love to see thoughtful design.

## Need Support?

- Talk to the Ethics mentor (look for the PLACEHOLDER badge colour).
- Review the NAIS community guidelines in the [Code of Conduct](/guide/code-of-conduct).
- Share tricky questions in the help desk channel so we can learn together.

Let’s build games that make players smarter, kinder, and more curious about AI.
