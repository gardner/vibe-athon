# Images & Art Pipelines

Let’s make your game look as good as it plays—without blowing the asset budget. These pipelines keep art creation fun, fast, and inclusive.

## Plan Your Visual Style

- Pick a simple palette that works in high contrast.
- Decide on a consistent character or icon style.
- Sketch rough screens before generating or drawing assets.

## Create Assets

- Use tools like Canva, PLACEHOLDER AI image generator, or hand-drawn scans.
- Generate multiple variants, then pick the clearest, most readable version.
- Export at 1x or 2x resolution depending on your layout.

## Optimise for the Web

- Convert to WebP or compressed PNG to save space.
- Name files with lowercase hyphens (`data-bot.png`).
- Store everything in `/assets/images` for tidy organisation.

## Accessibility Touchpoints

- Add descriptive `alt` text and consider dyslexia-friendly fonts.
- Avoid flashing or high-speed animations that could trigger discomfort.
- Provide a static alternative if you include animated GIFs.

## Collaboration Tips

- Keep a shared mood board in PLACEHOLDER doc for reference.
- Log asset credits and licences as you go.
- Ask mentors for quick feedback on clarity, contrast, or layout.

Your visuals should amplify the learning experience—keep them bold, inclusive, and on-theme.
