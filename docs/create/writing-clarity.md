# Writing Clarity

Great teaching games speak in clear, energetic language. These tips help you explain AI ideas without jargon overload.

## Keep It Human

- Write like you’d talk to a friend who’s curious about AI.
- Use short sentences and active verbs.
- Avoid buzzwords unless you define them in plain language.

## Explain Concepts in Steps

1. **Hook:** “Your AI buddy is acting weird.”
2. **Reveal:** “It’s hallucinating because the context window ran out.”
3. **Action:** “Choose which clues to keep to help it stay accurate.”
4. **Reflect:** “You just managed the context window like a pro.”

## Teach Through Play

- Use tooltips, HUD panels, or dialogue to deliver micro-lessons.
- Offer optional deep dives so players can learn more without slowing down gameplay.
- Celebrate learning moments with badges, sound effects, or celebratory text.

## Editing Pass

- Read every block of text aloud—does it flow?
- Highlight any jargon and swap in friendly explanations.
- Ask an LLM to “rewrite this paragraph for clarity without losing energy.”

## Inclusive Language

- Use gender-neutral terms and avoid stereotypes.
- Consider multiple reading levels—aim for Year 8 comprehension.
- Provide content warnings if you touch on sensitive themes.
