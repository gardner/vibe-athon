# Why Vibe-athon

We created the Vibe-athon to make AI literacy feel exciting, welcoming, and hands-on. Instead of passively consuming tech, participants become creators, teachers, and storytellers.

## Our Big Goals

- **Demystify AI:** Break down complex concepts into playful experiences.
- **Empower Communities:** Show that anyone can shape the future of technology.
- **Spark Collaboration:** Connect artists, educators, coders, and curious humans.
- **Celebrate Ethics:** Keep inclusion and responsibility at the centre of every build.

## What Makes It Different

- Static, no-backend builds keep judging simple and approachable.
- Templates and toolkits level the playing field for all skill levels.
- Mentor squads and lightweight roles encourage joyful collaboration.

Join us in building technology that feels human, kind, and full of possibility.
